# Capstone-Project
Education/GDP analysis. 

Capstone Project

Executive Summary
I will analyze data to discover how much is spent per state for education per student. I will compare it with the GDP per capita of each state. Finally, I will bring in data from another dataset to look at the top industries per state. I would like to see if expenditure on education effects GDP. I will also consider what industries are dominant and if they need well educated employees to thrive. If I have time, I would like to incorporate college graduate numbers as compared to expenditures on school per student.
Motivation
Questions that could be answered with this data might be helpful in motivating states to spend more on education, especially when it meets industry needs and affects college graduation rates.
The data will help educational agencies and employers to see the value of investing in education. The goal is to connect educational investment to GDP  and college graduation rates in a state. Neither of my parents graduated from college and education has provided opportunities for me that my parents did not have.
Data Question(s)
Have not seen data answering these questions specifically, but all the parts are easily available.

1.	What is the GDP per capita for each state?
2.	How much does each state spend on each student for education?
3.	What are the top industries in each state and what is each states average income per person? 
4.	What percentage of the population graduates from college?

1.	Get the Data (June 1st)
2.	Clean & Explore the Data (June 5th)
3.	Create Presentation and Shiny App (June 12th)
4.	Internal Demos (6/19/2020)
5.	Demo Day (6//2020)

Data Sources
Document the data you use and the source of that data (provide a link to the data when possible)

Known Issues and Challenges
Explain any anticipated challenges with your project, and your plan for managing them. 
It will be hard to join all this data cleanly. It will be a challenge to find education needs for an industry and show it in data. There will be some dead ends, and what I find may change what I present.




1. Clean data.
2. Explore datasets.
3. Create anylsis.
4. Create visuals for Presentation.
